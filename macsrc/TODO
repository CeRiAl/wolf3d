TODO:
* Correct copyrights
- vi_ are mostly mine, with portions based on the original code
- move stuff out of stub.c to more proper places
* Pause key
* SVGAlib Hack:
- Require 320x200x256
- If user requests a gamemode which SVGAlib says it does not support, fail
- If SVGAlib does not support 512x384x256, allow the user to pan around 
  with the keypad arrow keys.
* Finish moving all 2D code to SoftDraw.c
* Compile with -Wall -ansi -pedantic (shouldn't be much in the way)

BUGS:
* Drawing seems like its imprecise, stationary sprites move back and forth,
  and walls 'swim' when you move around, or sprites pop into different sizes
  when are far enough and get closer/farther away
- Possibly caused by 8.8 imprecision?
* it crashes somewhere, no reason why...
#0  0x804fa55 in DrawXMShape (x=128, y=96, ShapePtr=0x8c8c8c8c) at
Burger.c:198
But what is trashing GameShapes's memory?
* added an 'and' hack to lines 33 and 50 in RefBsp.c  Not sure if this causes
any problems (value was overflowing finetangent...)

IDEAS:
* Menu Keys
- ESC: Quit
- F1:  Help
- XXX: Load Game
- XXX: Load Previously Loaded Game
- XXX: Save Game
- XXX: Save Game to Previously used File
- XXX: Options
* How about adding red/white shifts (from PC wolf3d)? So screen changes
color when you are hit or pick up items.
* when saving/loading games, run them through htons/etc.
