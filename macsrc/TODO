* remove NOVGA when other ports are added. NOVGA is a hack for using
ElectricFence (since svgalib doesn't work too well with it)
* fix return value of DoEvents
* when you die, where do all the sprites go?
* drawing seems like its imprecise, stationary sprites move back and forth,
and walls 'swim' when you move around, or sprites pop into different sizes
when are far enough and get closer/farther away
* Word is 16bit damnit, wonder why in the MAC version its 32bits?!
* How about adding red/white shifts (from PC wolf3d)? 
* it crashes somewhere, no reason why...
* Pause key
