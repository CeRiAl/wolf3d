* remove NOVGA when other ports are added. NOVGA is a hack for using
ElectricFence (since svgalib doesn't work too well with it)
* finish defining all the keys 
* when you die, where do all the sprites go?
* drawing seems like its imprecise, stationary sprites move back and forth,
and walls 'swim' when you move around
* Word is 16bit damnit, wonder why in the MAC version its 32bits?!
* Automap movement is too fast
* How about adding red/white shifts (from PC wolf3d)?
