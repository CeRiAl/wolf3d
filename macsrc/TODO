* remove NOVGA when other ports are added. NOVGA is a hack for using
ElectricFence (since svgalib doesn't work too well with it)
* drawing seems like its imprecise, stationary sprites move back and forth,
and walls 'swim' when you move around, or sprites pop into different sizes
when are far enough and get closer/farther away
* Word is 16bit damnit, wonder why in the MAC version its 32bits?!
* How about adding red/white shifts (from PC wolf3d)? 
* it crashes somewhere, no reason why...
#0  0x804fa55 in DrawXMShape (x=128, y=96, ShapePtr=0x8c8c8c8c) at
Burger.c:198
But what is trashing GameShapes's memory?
I don't think GameShapes itself is being ran over, just the memory allocated
to it...
* Pause key
* menu type stuff in svgalib version (would use the Fx keys to save game
etc, text menus for options?)
* when saving/loading games, run them through htons/etc.
* added an 'and' hack to lines 33 and 50 in RefBsp.c  Not sure if this causes
any problems (value was overflowing finetangent...)

* forget about major svgalib support?
