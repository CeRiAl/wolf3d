General:
* inconsistancy:
id_ca.c has code for setting the data filenames' extension
so does wl_menu.c
* menu code is a mess, always does things differently than the rest of the
code, it really needs to be cleaned up
* id_ca.c cache code: nice idea but messy and maybe can be fixed 
in an effort to not allocate everything to memory and forget about it
some sort of garbage collection
* clean up header files, especially wl_def.h, where some declarations aren't 
in the right place
* every structure that is read/written must be PACKED, with datatypes
specifically set! (ie, no int, but short or long int)
* or at least have PACKED versions of read/write structures, and transfer
to/from just for reading, so only not-packed structures are used during
actual gameplay/etc. 
* is that memory intro screen needed anymore? probably not, although it
would be nice to show what version is loaded, but doom just printed text
and the intro screen which came with wolf3d has copyrighted images
* then, what about PG13? OH NO!!!! -- people would probably want the first
two screens for nostalga
* fix the input code, everything is spread out... ideally everything should
work the same, let the input handler do it all instead
* when viewsize is around 20, sprites end up being drawn over the border.
maybe there are clipping bugs that will cause it to fill over the top, left, 
and right (happens at any view basically, except this version of source does
not leave any artifacts after a few screen redraws)
* remove GOODTIMES (the piracy message is somewhat worthless)
* then consider removing the SOD manual check
* Use either US_CheckParm or MS_CheckParm.
* perhaps rename UPLOAD
* TOO MANY #IFDEFs
* and upload builds with lots of wl6 code anyway (sound references were just
ifndefed out)
* verify if the sounds and graphics are correctly numbered, once again...
* find out why shareware version produces these messages:
CA_FarRead only read 471 out of 1671
Trying to free null audio chunk 207!
CA_FarRead hit EOF?
CA_FarRead hit EOF?
CA_FarRead hit EOF?
* if possible fix/or at least add ViewMap?
* remove the #else at the end of each header since nothing is being doubly
included now (if ever)
* fix those tiles that do not wish to be extracted (latches or whathaveyou)
* i don't like this latch nonsense. i think it was for originally storing
data in vga memory. so figure it out, fix it, and remove
* especially with the video functions, there are functions/defines which
just call a different function (most are left from the update block code)
rename/remove them
* fix wl_debug.c, lots of junk code..
* change the current parameter handling code to something like getopt
* urgent: fix input (event handling), so that it makes sense
* wl_menu.c does loops on Keyboard.  should call id_in functions instead
* rename goobers to debugmode, then remove debugmode for things...
* for some reason, it feels sluggish, maybe its from having mikmod playing
at the same time... especially when you pick up items
* look for places where gfx needs to be redrawn, like back to game etc 
* wl_menu uses specific scancodes for names, config file will have to use
metaname like sc_Left etc or something
* fizzlefade is hackish, stipple buf would work ok in opengl, maybe only
update once per frame or such.. hm
and where is that greenpixel coming from (when using end game with largest
window size)
* change id_sd to sd_oss, sd_win, sd_dos, sd_oal, etc
idea is that different <outputs> can share some drivers, unlike video
* check filehandling (ex, file missing, bad file type, and such)
PlayDemoFromFile specifically
* make sure all infinite loops are found (looping around Keyboard)

Specific:
* memory/sound intro screen goes
  - Trademarked images, only came with wolf3d 1.4's (I believe)
* copy protection goes
  - Who needs a manual to look at the source?
