* inconsistancy:
id_ca.c has code for setting the extension to load files
so does wl_menu.c
* menu code is a mess, always does things differently than the rest of the
code, it really needs to be cleaned up
* id_ca.c cache code: nice idea but messy and maybe can be fixed 
in an effort to not allocate everything to memory and forget about it
some sort of garbage collection
* clean up header files, especially wl_def.h, where some externs arent in
the right place
* every structure that is read/written must be PACKED, with datatypes
specifically set! (ie, no int, but short or long int)
* is that memory intro screen needed anymore? probably not
* fix the input code, everything is spread out... ideally everything should
work the same, let the input handler do it all instead
* when viewsize is around 20, sprites end up being drawn over the border.
maybe there are clipping bugs that will cause it to fill over the top, left, 
and right
