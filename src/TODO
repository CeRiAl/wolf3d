General:
* inconsistancy:
id_ca.c has code for setting the data filenames' extension
so does wl_menu.c
* menu code is a mess, always does things differently than the rest of the
code, it really needs to be cleaned up
* id_ca.c cache code: nice idea but messy and maybe can be fixed 
in an effort to not allocate everything to memory and forget about it
some sort of garbage collection
* clean up header files, especially wl_def.h, where some declarations aren't 
in the right place
* every structure that is read/written must be PACKED, with datatypes
specifically set! (ie, no int, but short or long int)
* or at least have PACKED versions of read/write structures, and transfer
to/from just for reading, so only not-packed structures are used during
actual gameplay/etc. 
* is that memory intro screen needed anymore? probably not, although it
would be nice to show what version is loaded, but doom just printed text
and the intro screen which came with wolf3d has copyrighted/trademarked images
maybe make a new intro screen...
* then, what about PG13? OH NO!!!! -- people would probably want the first
two screens for nostalga
* fix the input code, everything is spread out... ideally everything should
work the same, let the input handler do it all instead
i think its safe for now to go with the scancodes as being the "universal"
key type, and for everything not scancode-based, have a function to
translate
* remove GOODTIMES?
* Consider removing the SOD manual check
* perhaps rename UPLOAD
* TOO MANY #IFDEFs
* and upload builds with lots of wl6 code anyway (sound references were just
ifndefed out)
* verify if the sounds and graphics are correctly numbered, once again...
* add a ViewMap? 
* remove the #else at the end of each header since nothing is being doubly
included now (if ever)
* find and remove any function stubs (functions which just call another
function with same parameters, only difference is the name)
* fix wl_debug.c, lots of junk code..
* change the current parameter handling code to something like getopt
* rename goobers to debugmode, then remove debugmode for things...
* for some reason, it feels sluggish, maybe its from having mikmod playing
at the same time... especially when you pick up items.. probably due to
calling wait vbl when doing palette stuffs
* look for places where gfx needs to be redrawn, like back to game etc 
* wl_menu uses specific scancodes for names, config file will have to use
metaname like sc_Left etc or something
* fizzlefade is hackish, stipple buf would work ok in opengl, maybe only
update once per frame or such.. hm
and where is that stray pixel coming from (when using end game with largest
window size) in svgalib
no idea how to do fizzlefade in 16bit X
* change id_sd to sd_oss, sd_win, sd_dos, sd_oal, etc
idea is that different <outputs> can share some drivers, unlike video
although glx and x11 share a lot of code (i guess since gl will be a great
undertaking, better to keep them seperated)
* check filehandling (ex, file missing, bad file type, and such)
PlayDemoFromFile specifically
* make sure all infinite loops are found (looping around Keyboard)
* deathcam went by too fast, and right before the fizzlefade was being done
on the border
same with the spear of destiny animation part of ending
* move all references to gfxbuf to vi_* only (gl will need this anyway,
since it deprecates: id_vh, (parts of) wl_draw, wl_scale)
by putting in code from id_vh (either by using Plot or just copying it in)
we can stop the large conversion before each UpdateScreen
but palette fades will still need it! damnit
* what are special keys... ?
* the higher depths are a hack since a palette lookup has to be done
for every byte when transferring to the pixmap, palette fades require a
screen update
* make sure none of the code tries to handle gfx/sound data directly
* GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette for opengl
* if window looses focus, should it clear the keys ?
* clean up vi_xlib.c: fix vid mode changing, fix dga for non8bit modes and
the nonpalette setting stuff... lots of if statements
* fix broken opengl.. argh wolf3d updates lots of stuff used in other parts
of the game (namely stuff used for hit testing when firing weapon) in the
draw loop.. start by cp wl_draw.c vi_ogl.c and just take out the actual
drawing bits and replace with opengl.
* rename visable to visible
* fix up windows port
* create 'sound channels' with priority.. ie a door can only make one sound
at a time
* beos is c++ (and uses gcc as a compiler i think) but wolf3d will need many
cleanups for c++
either that or use extern "C" { ... } in the header files
* change wl_scale to use mac wolf3d's version of scaling
wall drawing is done, just needed to fix sprite code
* check in wolftools and add mac wolftools (currently the res dumping stuff)
* have vi_xlib.c compile without the extensions
* cat file.c | perl -e 'while($in = <STDIN>)
{$in =~ s/\/\/(.*)$/\/\* \1\ *\//gm;print $in;}'
or
cat foo.txt |sed -e "s/\/\/\(.*\)$/\/\*\1\*\//g"
* oal version locks up at end of level (hit switch but before the ratios)
the api is a bit unstable at the moment so wait for 1.0 of linux version to
be released before fixing it, although that lame sampling bug got fixed

Things to try:
* Any speed gain with comparing values in screen before writing?
* Convert to a 320x200xWhatever screen first then draw all at once
* Create a native palette format instead of doing conversions each frame
