* inconsistancy:
id_ca.c has code for setting the extension to load files
so does wl_menu.c
* menu code is a mess, always does things differently than the rest of the
code, it really needs to be cleaned up
* id_ca.c cache code: nice idea but messy and maybe can be fixed 
in an effort to not allocate everything to memory and forget about it
some sort of garbage collection
* clean up header files, especially wl_def.h, where some externs arent in
the right place
* every structure that is read/written must be PACKED, with datatypes
specifically set! (ie, no int, but short or long int)
* is that memory intro screen needed anymore? probably not
* fix the input code, everything is spread out... ideally everything should
work the same, let the input handler do it all instead
* when viewsize is around 20, sprites end up being drawn over the border.
maybe there are clipping bugs that will cause it to fill over the top, left, 
and right
* if japan versions are not to be found, remove the code 
* remove DEMOEXTERN, and add ability to play demos from commandline 
* remove SPANISH code (and spanish.h)? honestly i would rather have a german
version than a spanish version
* remove GOODTIMES (the piracy message is somewhat worthless)
* then consider removing the SOD manual check
* fix wolf shareware gfx
* fix status bar gfx junk, and those tiles that do not wish to be extracted
* Use either US_CheckParm or MS_CheckParm.
* perhaps rename UPLOAD
TOO MANY #IFDEF.
and upload builds with lots of wl6 code anyway (sound references were just
ifdefed
* verify if the sounds and graphics are correctly numbered, once again...
* remove -fwritable-strings
* find out why shareware version produces these messages:
CA_FarRead only read 471 out of 1671
Trying to free null audio chunk 207!
CA_FarRead hit EOF?
CA_FarRead hit EOF?
CA_FarRead hit EOF?
