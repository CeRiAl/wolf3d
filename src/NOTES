Wolfenstein 3D was originally planned to be a much more complex game. ...
... lots of unused code ... possibly from previous projects and incarnations
of wolf3d.

Version 1.4 of Wolfenstein 3D (full) did not had a Read Me! option, but the 
text still exists in the data files, but all the graphics are incorrect
(wrong graphic numbers, etc).
