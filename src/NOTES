Just some random facts/thoughts/ideas/musings:

Wolfenstein 3D was originally planned to be a much more complex game. ...
... lots of unused code ... possibly from previous projects and incarnations
of wolf3d.

1.4 of Wolfenstein 3D (full) had a Read Me! option. The text still exists in
the data file, but all the graphics are off.
