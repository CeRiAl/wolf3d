TODO: I still need to write this file

Save game and configuration file formats are not yet "solid" (files created
with an older version may not work with a new binary), but they probably
won't have to change.

Sound support is still "experiemental."  Currently requires OSS support.
Edit the Makefile and change:
 OBJS += sd_null.o
 #OBJS += sd_oss.o fmopl.o
 #CFLAGS += -D_REENTRANT
 #LFLAGS += -lpthread
to:
 #OBJS += sd_null.o
 OBJS += sd_oss.o fmopl.o
 CFLAGS += -D_REENTRANT
 LFLAGS += -lpthread
and recompile.  Hopefully it doesn't sound too terrible...

NOTE: This requires SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org)

NOTE: edit version.h to change the gametype.
