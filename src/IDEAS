* One binary, any game type. Store certain things in a new file?
* A key to change viewsize at runtime (max == 20, min == 5 or so...)
* Game able to cope at any virtual resolution in software mode. OpenGL
  handles this transparently
* Audio support using OpenAL
  - Problem is, that SDL and OpenAL would need pthread, which with SVGAlib is
    a no-go... oh well.
* Add support for the Mac version, if possible
* Network support!
* Fully compile with no warnings/errors using -Wall -ansi -pedantic
* Port to: Linux/SVGAlib, Linux/X, Linux/OpenGL, DOS/Allegro, Win32/GDI, 
  Win32/DX, Win32/D3D, Win32/OpenGL, BeOS?, MacOS?
* Ease in using demos. Playing demos from files, recording to files, batch
  playing, and so on.
