------------- Please Disregard the Following Outdated Text: ----------------
* One binary, any game type.
* A key to change viewsize while playing (note: max == 20, min == 5 or so...)
* Game able to cope at any virtual resolution in software mode. OpenGL
  handles this transparently (after setting correct glViewport)
* Audio support using OpenAL
* Add support for the Mac version, if possible
* Network support!
* Fully compile with no warnings/errors using -Wall -ansi -pedantic and with
  other compilers (would need to turn off warnings about unused parameters)
* Port to: Linux/SVGAlib, Linux/X (Windowed and DGA), Linux/OpenGL, 
  DOS/Allegro?, Win32/GDI?, Win32/DX, Win32/D3D?, Win32/OpenGL, BeOS?, MacOS?,
  QNX?
* Ease in using demos. Playing demos from files, recording to files, batch
  playing, and so on.
* Make Wolf3D the game it was originally planned to be...  More strategy...
* Empty TODO File (TODO states a list of things which need to/should be done
  regardless of future plans [IDEAS]) and no TODO/FIXMEs in the source 
  code
* Test with other available mods (that were compatible with the original
  game)
* Unified input handling
* Configuration files and save games which work regardless of operating
  system/processor/binary build
* Suite of utilities to edit the game data.
